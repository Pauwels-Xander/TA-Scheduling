# TA-Scheduling
How to schedule Teaching Assistants based off of their availability and preferences?

In this report, we investigate a tutorial assignment problem arising from the need to allocate
teaching assistants (TAs) to multiple tutorial sessions. Each TA has limited availability, specific
time-slot preferences, and is permitted to lead no more than two tutorials. We formulate the
problem as a mixed-integer linear program that ensures every session is adequately staffed while
maximizing the alignment between TA preferences and their assigned sessions. To verify the
robustness of our model, we perform sensitivity checks by varying TA availability and preference parameters to assess how changes affect the optimal assignment. The optimal assignment
derived from our model significantly outperforms a manually constructed alternative in terms
of preference satisfaction, even under these perturbed scenarios.
